# Column Formatting samples for SharePoint and Microsoft Lists

Samples for use with Column Formatting in SharePoint (2019 & Online) and Microsoft Lists. Samples are organized into dedicated folders with READMEs, screenshots, and everything needed to apply the sample in your own environment.

Folders are organized by column type (generic applies to any column type whose value is simple text). However, there is a dedicated listing of column samples in our documentation site along with groupings to help find exactly the sample you need:

* [Column Samples](https://pnp.github.io/List-Formatting/columnsamples/) - Friendly display of ALL column samples
* [Groupings](https://pnp.github.io/List-Formatting/groupings/columntype/) - Various listings of samples by operators, tokens, author, class usage, etc.

> Note: Excel-style expressions are not supported in SharePoint 2019. You need to use the AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) versions of samples which are provided in some cases. There is a [dedicated page for samples supported in SharePoint 2019](https://pnp.github.io/List-Formatting/groupings/SP2019/).
