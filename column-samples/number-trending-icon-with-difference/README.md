# Show trending up/trending down icons with value difference

## Summary
This example relies on two number fields, `Before` and `After`, for which the values can be compared. It shows the appropriate trending icon next to the value of the `After` field, depending on that field's value compared to the value in `Before`. The `sp-field-trending--up` class is used when `After`'s value is higher; the `sp-field-trending--down` class is used when `After`'s value is lower. No icon is shown when they are equal (padding is added to keep consistent alignment).

The example also displays the difference in value between the `Before` and `After` values. If the `After` value is larger then the `Before` value, the numeric value difference will be displayed with a `(+XX)`. If the `After` value is smaller then the `Before` value, the numeric value difference will be displayed with a `(-XX)`.

The difference values are in a `<span>`, separate from the `After` `<span>`, allowing for unique properties to be applied without altering the `After` value.
