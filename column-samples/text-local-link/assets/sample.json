The primary purpose is to demonstrate the usage of \u0060@currentWeb\u0060 (O365 only) to prevent issues with reusable formats or formats rendered outside of the main list view. This format links to other lists, but this could just as easily be specific pages/files/etc. on a site.",

To do this, you construct a JSON object that describes the elements that are displayed when a field is included in a list view, and the styles to be applied to those elements. The column formatting does not change the data in the list item or file; it only changes how it\u2019s displayed to users who browse the list.",
