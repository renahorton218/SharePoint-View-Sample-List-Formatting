In this case the status values are separated with a colon (\u0060:\u0060). The first part is a general category such as Not Started, In Progress, or Resolved. The second part is the detailed reason for the status. Since these values are within the same column it becomes necessary to break the value apart.",

To do this, you construct a JSON object that describes the elements that are displayed when a field is included in a list view, and the styles to be applied to those elements. The column formatting does not change the data in the list item or file; it only changes how it\u2019s displayed to users who browse the list.",
