# Formatting an ISBN (text column) to book cover image. Images are retrieved by calling Open Library Covers API.

## Summary
This example retrieves book cover images based on their ISBN numbers by utilizing the [Open Library Covers API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers). The API works by building a cover image URL with the ISBN.

This sample retrieves the small (S) image, but there are also medium (M) and large (L) sizes available. Simply swap out the `S` in `-S.jpg` portion of the `src` attribute in the `img` element to retrieve one of the other sizes.

> The values are expected to be the ISBN numbers for the books. However, this sample could easily be switched to utilize the OCLC, LCCN, OLID, or ID values for a given book.

## View requirements
- This format can be applied to a text/choice column and expects the values to be ISBN numbers corresponding to books
