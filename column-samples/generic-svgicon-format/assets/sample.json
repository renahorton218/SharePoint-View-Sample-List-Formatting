Fortunately, you can use inline SVG elements with custom paths. This means you can use icons from sources like Font Awesome that provide SVG versions of their icons! This sample uses the value of the current field to show a custom icon and color. The icon is specified through the d attribute of the path element. The paths have been scaled and extracted from Font Awesome icons. This sample uses gender and provides a default display when neither Male nor Female is selected."
