    "shortDescription": "This example shows how to turn a text field that contains stock ticker symbols into a hyperlink that targets the Yahoo Finance real-time quotes page for that stock ticker. The example uses a \u0060\u002B\u0060 operator that appends the current field value to the static hyperlink \u003Ca\u003Ehttp://finance.yahoo.com/quote/\u003C/a\u003E. You can extend this pattern to any scenario in which you want users to view contextual information related to an item, or you want to start a business process on the current item, as long as the information or process can be accessed via a hyperlink parameterized with values from the list item.",

To do this, you construct a JSON object that describes the elements that are displayed when a field is included in a list view, and the styles to be applied to those elements. The column formatting does not change the data in the list item or file; it only changes how it\u2019s displayed to users who browse the list.",
