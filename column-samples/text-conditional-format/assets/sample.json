    "shortDescription": "You can apply conditional formatting to text or choice fields that might contain a fixed set of values. The following example applies different classes depending on whether the value of the field is Done, In Review, Blocked, or another value. This example applies a CSS class (\u0060sp-field-severity--low, sp-field-severity--good, sp-field-severity--warning, sp-field-severity--blocked\u0060) to the  \u0060\u003Cdiv /\u003E\u0060 based on the field\u0027s value. This is what determines the element\u0027s background color. A class of \u0060ms-fontColor-neutralSecondary\u0060 is always applied to ensure the text color is legible in both light and dark themes. Then, it outputs a \u0060\u003Cspan /\u003E\u0060 element with an \u0060iconName\u0060 attribute. This attribute applies another CSS class to that \u0060\u003Cspan /\u003E\u0060 that shows an [Office UI Fabric](https://dev.office.com/fabric#/) icon inside that element. Finally, another \u0060\u003Cspan /\u003E\u0060 element is outputted that contains the value inside the field.",
