This example applies formatting to one field by looking at the value inside another field. Note that DueDate is referenced using the \u0060[$FieldName]\u0060 syntax. FieldName is assumed to be the internal name of the field. This example also takes advantage of a special value that can be used in date/time fields - \u0060@now\u0060, which resolves to the current date/time, evaluated when the user loads the list view.",

To do this, you construct a JSON object that describes the elements that are displayed when a field is included in a list view, and the styles to be applied to those elements. The column formatting does not change the data in the list item or file; it only changes how it\u2019s displayed to users who browse the list.",
