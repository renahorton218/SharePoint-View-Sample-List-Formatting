# Like / Dislike - Unique reaction

## Summary
This is a sample demonstrates the usage of the `setValue` action and array manipulation using `removeFrom` and `appendTo` on multiple fields at the same time, by creating buttons to like/dislike an item and updating two multi person fields, one used to save the likes (people who liked), the other one to save the dislikes (people who disliked).

A user can only either like or dislike an item, if an item is liked by the current and is disliked, the like is undone and vice-versa (similar to what happens in YouTube).
