# Display Location Weather Details

## Summary

This sample pulls out sub properties of a Location column to build an image `src` that pulls weather from [WeatherForYou.com](https://www.weatherforyou.com/).

> Note: The WeatherForYou weather snapshots do NOT require an API key and is completely free to use. However, it is limited to locations within the United States only. Locations outside of the US will not show the format.

## View requirements
- This format can be applied to a location column (to reference a location column instead you can switch the calls from `@currentField` to the column reference format. For example, `@currentField.Address.City` to `[$INTERNALNAME.Address.City]`)
