They show the appropriate trending icon next to the value of the After field, depending on that field's value compared to the value in Before. The sp-field-trending--up class is used when After's value is higher; the sp-field-trending--down class is used when After's value is lower. No icon is shown when they are equal (padding is added to keep consistent alignment).",

To do this, you construct a JSON object that describes the elements that are displayed when a field is included in a list view, and the styles to be applied to those elements. The column formatting does not change the data in the list item or file; it only changes how it\u2019s displayed to users who browse the list.",
