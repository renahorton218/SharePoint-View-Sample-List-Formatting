# Concatenate Currency Symbol to Numberic Columns

Currency column is not currently supported, hence this sample will allow the users to concatenate a currency symbol(£, $ ... etc.) to the existing data.  This sample will allow users to compare two numeric columns and add a currrency symbol. In this example, two columns (Budget Approved and Expenditure To Date) from a  Project Register has been used.


### Project Budget Column
Project Register where ‘Project Budget’ column is compared with the 'Expenditure To Date' column and formated with Red or Green color.
![Alt text](https://github.com/sohailmerchant/spo-columnformatting/blob/master/project%20management/project%20register.png).  Please note that both columns must be number type.

If you need to add  only a currency symbol to the Project Budget column with any formatting, use text.json sample:

Similar technique could be used for adding any text to current existing or empty column.
