# Concatenate Currency Symbol to Numberic Columns

Currency column is not currently supported, hence this sample will allow the users to concatenate a currency symbol(£, $ ... etc.) to the existing data.  This sample will allow users to compare two numeric columns and add a currrency symbol. In this example, two columns (Budget Approved and Expenditure To Date) from a  Project Register has been used.


### Project Budget Column
Project Register where ‘Project Budget’ column is compared with the 'Expenditure To Date' column and formated with Red or Green color. Please note that both columns must be number type.

If you need to add  only a currency symbol to the Project Budget column with any formatting, use addsymbolonly.json sample:

Similar technique could be used for adding any text to existing data or empty column.
