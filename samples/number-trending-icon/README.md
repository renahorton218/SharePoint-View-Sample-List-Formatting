# Show trending up/trending down icons 

## Summary
This example relies on two number fields, `Before` and `After`, for which the values can be compared. It shows the appropriate trending icon next to the `After` field, depending on that field's value compared to the value in `Before`.  `sp-field-trending--up` is used when `After`'s value is higher; `sp-field-trending--down` is used when `After`'s value is lower.
