# Resource Catalog Sample

## Summary

SharePoint lists are excellent places to store information.  This example demonstrates how to use a custom SharePoint list to implement a marketing resources catalog.  This sample defines a custom view to bring focus to the status of items in the resource catalog.  It also provides a better visual experience by displaying all the data in an easy to read format by using icons, colors, and profile pictures.

## View requirements

The view must include these columns:

### Standard columns

- LinkTitle
- Modified

### Custom columns

Column Name|Type
-----------|----
ResourcePillar | Text
ResourceTechnology | Text
ResourceStatus | Text
ResourcePublic | Boolean
ResourceOwner | User

## Site Script

This sample includes a site script ([create-list.json](create-list.json)) that creates the required site columns, the Resource Catalog list, and a new view named **All Items - customized** in the list that contains all the required columns.

See the [SharePoint site design and site script overview article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/site-design-overview) to learn how to use the site script.
