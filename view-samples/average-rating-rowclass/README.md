### Prerequisites
The ratings feature is available by default in the team site, but not in the communication site. If you want to use the ratings feature in the list of communication sites, you need to enable the feature GUID ` 915c240e-a6cc-49b8-8b2c-0bff8b553ed3`. The following is an example of how to enable it using [PnP PowerShell](https://pnp.github.io/powershell).

```
$targetURL = "https://tenent.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite"
Connect-PnPOnline -Url $targetURL -Interactive
Enable-PnPFeature â€“identity 915c240e-a6cc-49b8-8b2c-0bff8b553ed3 -Scope site
```
