      "This sample demonstrates the use of dynamic connections in the list webpart while using a custom format. The format is applied to a list of YouTube videos with each item containing the shortcode for the video. On a page, the list webpart with the custom view is used. The embed webpart is configured to accept it as a connection. This results in a custom video selection application that changes the embeded video on the page."
