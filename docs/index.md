# List Formatting Samples

You can use List Formatting to customize how fields and views in SharePoint lists and libraries are displayed. List formatting allows you to quickly and easily add instant meaning, visual appeal, and dynamic visualizations to your lists.

List Formatting is applied by constructing a JSON object that describes the elements that are displayed for a field or view and the styles to be applied to those elements.

This repository contains ready to use samples. You can use these samples as starting points for your own formats or simply copy and paste them directly to your lists!

## Organization

This repo is divided up into 3 main sections:

- **column-samples**: Column Formatting samples
- **view-samples**: View Formatting samples
- **tools**: tools/scripts for advanced scenarios

You can head directly to those folders and start looking around if you'd like. But if you're looking for something specific, we've grouped our samples into various categories:

- [By Column Type](./groupings/columntype.md)
- [By Operator](./groupings/operator.md)
- [By Placeholder Token](./groupings/token.md)
- [By Row Action](./groupings/action.md)
- [By Category](./groupings/category.md)
- [By Contributor](./groupings/contributor.md)
