- :fontawesome-solid-file-lines:{.formIcon title="Form Format"} [Blank Header](https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting/tree/master/form-samples/blank-header){target=_blank title="blank-header (Form): By default, uncustomized list forms display the Title field at the top. This is generally fine, but sometimes you may not want this (especially since the default is to repeat it as the first column). This very basic format removes the default Title display giving you a cleaner form."}
- :fontawesome-solid-file-lines:{.formIcon title="Form Format"} [Dashed Line Header](https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting/tree/master/form-samples/dashed-line-header){target=_blank title="dashed-line-header (Form): This sample displays the Title and Description values in the heading and decorates them with dashed lines. If the Description value is empty, it will be hidden."}
- :fontawesome-solid-file-lines:{.formIcon title="Form Format"} [Event Itinerary Header](https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting/tree/master/form-samples/event-itinerary-header){target=_blank title="event-itinerary-header (Form): This sample shows a customized header for the item form used in the "Event itinerary" list template."}
- :fontawesome-solid-file-lines:{.formIcon title="Form Format"} [Ribbon Header](https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting/tree/master/form-samples/ribbon-header){target=_blank title="ribbon-header (Form): This sample demonstrates displaying a ribbon in the header."}
- :fontawesome-solid-file-lines:{.formIcon title="Form Format"} [Status Header and Footer](https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting/tree/master/form-samples/status-header-footer){target=_blank title="status-header-footer (Form): This sample shows a customized header and footer for a form with a Status column with possible values 'Thinking about it', 'Working on it', 'Done', and 'Nevermind'. This format is intended for the Header Format and Footer Format of the form body in the Configure Layout panel. Depending on the value of the Status column, a corresponding icon and colour scheme are used."}
- :fontawesome-solid-file-lines:{.formIcon title="Form Format"} [Wave Header and Footer](https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting/tree/master/form-samples/wave-header-footer){target=_blank title="wave-header-footer (Form): This sample demonstrates how to display waves in the header and footer of a form. Waves are displayed using SVG."}
- :fontawesome-solid-file-lines:{.formIcon title="Form Format"} [Workflow Progress Header](https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting/tree/master/form-samples/workflow-progress-header){target=_blank title="workflow-progress-header (Form): This sample shows a checkmark for each date field that has a value to help convey when milestones have been hit."}
- :fontawesome-solid-file-lines:{.formIcon title="Form Format"} [Wrapped Form Body](https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting/tree/master/form-samples/wrapped-body){target=_blank title="wrapped-body (Form): By default, uncustomized list forms display the fields in a single column. This is generally fine, but sometimes you may want to use more horizontal space and have your fields wrap. This is not technically a format but rather a body layout. No columns or sections are specified meaning that this can be applied to any form and it won't change the order of display or what columns are visible it simply adds the wrapping."}
