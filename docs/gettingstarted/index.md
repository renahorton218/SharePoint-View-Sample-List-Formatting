# Getting Started

Each sample is located in it's own folder with a README file that provides details about how it was made and what it's demonstrating, column/view requirements, and any extra information to help you get the most out of it.

The samples themselves are located in the `.json` file(s) within each sample. You can copy and paste directly from these files right into your site!

## Using samples directly from github

1. Navigate to a **sample folder**
2. Ensure your column/view meets the listed **View Requirements**
3. Click on the **`.json` sample file**
4. **Copy** the JSON directly from the screen
5. **Paste** into your site!
