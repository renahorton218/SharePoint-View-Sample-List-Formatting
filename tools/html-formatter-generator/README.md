## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn start`

starts a local webserver which live-reloads on any edits you make to the code under src directory.
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the app, after compilation is successful.

If you want a faster dev-deployment experience, change `isProduction` to `false` and get faster live reloading.
